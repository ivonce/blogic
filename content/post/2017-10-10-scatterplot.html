<p>Here we can see how to make our own Scatterplot!</p>
<p>First, we have to install the following pakages:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)
library(ggplot2)</code></pre>
<p>When we installed the pakages, we are going to find the career of homeruns and strikeouts from players who had more than 400 homeruns.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>query&lt;-&quot;SELECT playerID,sum(HR) AS career_HR,sum(SO) AS career_so
FROM Batting
GROUP BY playerID 
HAVING sum(HR)&gt;=400&quot;
result&lt;-sqldf(query)</code></pre>
<p>To make a graph we would have to use ggplot2. You can also use diffrent colors and sizes.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot()+
  geom_point(data=result,aes(x=career_so,y=career_HR),size=3,color=&quot;purple&quot;)+
  ggtitle(&quot;career Strikeouts VS Homeruns for Great Hitters&quot;)+
  xlab(&quot;career Strikeouts&quot;)+
    ylab(&quot;career Homeruns&quot;)</code></pre>
