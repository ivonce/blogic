      <description>Here we can see how to make our own Scatterplot!
First, we have to install the following pakages:
library(Lahman) library(sqldf) library(ggplot2) When we installed the pakages, we are going to find the career of homeruns and strikeouts from players who had more than 400 homeruns.
query&amp;lt;-&amp;quot;SELECT playerID,sum(HR) AS career_HR,sum(SO) AS career_so FROM Batting GROUP BY playerID HAVING sum(HR)&amp;gt;=400&amp;quot; result&amp;lt;-sqldf(query) To make a graph we would have to use ggplot2. You can also use diffrent colors and sizes.</description>
