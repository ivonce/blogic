Here we can see how to make our own Scatterplot!

First, we have to install the following pakages:
```{r warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)
library(ggplot2)

```

When we installed the pakages, we are going to find the career of homeruns and strikeouts from players who had more than 400 homeruns.


```{r}

query<-"SELECT playerID,sum(HR) AS career_HR,sum(SO) AS career_so
FROM Batting
GROUP BY playerID 
HAVING sum(HR)>=400"
result<-sqldf(query)
```

To make a graph we would have to use ggplot2. 
You can also use diffrent colors and sizes.

```{r}
ggplot()+
  geom_point(data=result,aes(x=career_so,y=career_HR),size=3,color="purple")+
  ggtitle("career Strikeouts VS Homeruns for Great Hitters")+
  xlab("career Strikeouts")+
    ylab("career Homeruns")
```
