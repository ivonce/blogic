Here is the instruction how to make Time Series.

Like everywhere, first we have to install the pakages:

```{r warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)
library(ggplot2)
```

In this example we want to see Babe Ruthâ€™s homeruns over his career in baseball.
```{r}
query<-"SELECT yearID,HR FROM Batting WHERE playerID='ruthba01'"
result<-sqldf(query)
```

Now we want to make the paragraf, and for that we need ggplot2:

```{r}
ggplot()+
  geom_line(data=result,aes(x=yearID,y=HR))+
  geom_point(data=result,aes(x=yearID,y=HR))+
  ggtitle("Ruth's Homerans Totals Trough the Years")+
  xlab("Year")+
  ylab("Homeruns")
```
